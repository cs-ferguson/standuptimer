# The Standup Timer
A stand-up timer for scrums/stand-ups.

##Features
* Multiple teams
* Toggle attendance
* Modify timer length
* Uses Speech API to say name or phrase of your choosing to cue up team member
* Add a nice background image or video when team member is being summoned
* Play/pause, skip to next, go back to last, reset or escape the timer
* Gongs them if they run out of time
* Custom going message and background image or video.

I also have a roadmap [here](https://www.notion.so/Standup-Timer-Roadmap-d7f46ae2f4df436cb48ec4a2a36abc32)

## Developers
Uses create-react-app with little to no modifications. Run ```npm run start``` to get going.
Uses modular css with node-sass compiler to allow the joys of sass/scss.
